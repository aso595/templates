Also sold under various other brand names, including Jules V, Bakibo (Labelled on the sockets as Bakiko).

There are several versions of these. Same model number but different internals.
If the above does not work, alternative templates are:

```console
 {"NAME":"NX-SM112","GPIO":[0,0,0,131,134,132,0,0,158,17,0,21,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":45}
```

Slitinto Sockets:

```console
 {"NAME":"NX-SM112","GPIO":[158,0,0,131,134,132,0,0,0,17,0,21,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":45}
```

These are a smaller form factor plug which do not foul the switch on UK sockets.

Be cautious when puchasing as there are some versions which look identical but do not come with energy monitoring.

Comes with TLS firmware but flashable with the latest tuya-convert.
